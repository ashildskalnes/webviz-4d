### Welcome to Webviz-4D for Johan Sverdrup
![width=100%](./image.jpg "Johan Sverdrup")

Webviz-4D is built on webviz-subsurface, but has been customized to only display maps showing timelapse differences.

In this setup we have a configuration that will load:

* Observed 4D attribute maps from **OSDU Core** (exported from Openworks)
* Field outline and fault polygons from **SUMO**
* Drilled wellbores from **SMDA**
* Planned wellbores from **POZO**
* Production/injection data from **PDM**
